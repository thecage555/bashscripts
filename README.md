# bashscripts
This repository is specifically made to house scripts for setup of a lan based Ubuntu server.
It does video streaming and hosts a local network webportal for printing purposes.
The scripts are made to make the setup of the majority of settings easy in case it dies eventually.
Feel free to use them for whatever or get inspired by my very basic scripts.
All the scripts do is install some programs and updates, aswell as define some settings for things like SSH, Apache and Samba.
